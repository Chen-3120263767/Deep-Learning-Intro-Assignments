**Description**

The purpose of this repository is to record the practical assignments from the Introduction to Deep Learning course at Tsinghua University, which teaches neural networks from scratch. This repository will be continuously updated, and currently includes the following assignments:

- HW1: Manual construction of gradient descent and Classification prediction for the MNIST dataset.(based on numpy, not pytorch)

- HW2: Manually build MLP for classifying mnist data(based on numpy, not pytorch). The obtained loss decreases slowly and the accuracy is low, and the reason is still under investigation.
